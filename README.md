# Inline::Scheme::Gambit

This is a Perl 6 module which allows execution of Gambit Scheme code from
Perl 6 code with inspiration from other Inline:: modules like
Inline::Python, Inline::Lua, Inline::Scheme::Guile, etc.

## Synopsis

    use Inline::Scheme::Gambit;

    my $gambit = Inline::Scheme::Gambit.new;

    my $code = q:to/END/;
        (define (fib n)
         (if (< n 2) n (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))
    END

    $gambit.run($code);
    say $gambit.call('fib', 8);

    say $gambit.call('map',
                     $gambit.run(q{(lambda (n) (fib n))}),
                     [0 .. 8]);

## Status

Testing has only been done under Rakudo MoarVM on x86-64 Linux and
Gambit-C 4.8.3, although other combinations may also work. 

Values can be passed to and returned from Gambit-C. Simple types
like boolean, integer, number, string, list, table, vector should
work. Present mapping between Gambit-C and Perl 6 types is as
following table. 

    Gambit-C        from Perl                           to Perl
    boolean         Bool                                Bool
    integer         Int                                 long
    number          Num,Rat                             Num
    string          Stringy                             Str
    list            Positional                          Array            
    table           Associative                         Hash            
    vector                                              Array
    procedure                                           OpaquePointer
    other objects   OpaquePointer                       OpaquePointer

Note that at present both scheme list and vector converts to Array
in Perl 6, but through the call() method (see below) Perl 6 Array only
converts to list. 

The API is incomplete and experimental. It may change in future if
necessary.

### To Do

* Think about wrapping OpaquePointer for scheme-object, so that it can
do better on scheme list/vector/procedure/etc.
* Support scheme record type. 
* Improve error handling. 

## Install

The author does static linking to the default libgambit.a on his Linux
distribution, and at present Build.pm and Makefile.in is somewhat ad-hoc.
You may need to modify those files for this module to build on your
machine. 

## Usage

### Inline::Scheme::Gambit

Object of Inline::Scheme::Gambit represents a global Gambit-C instance. 

#### method new()

Returns the global Inline::Scheme::Gambit singleton. The first call to
new() initializes the singleton. 

#### method run(Str:D $code)

Runs $code and returns any resulting value.

#### method call(Str:D $name, \*\*@args)

Calls the named function with @args, and returns any resulting value.
